A TILT TOWARDS MORE DOM MANIPULATION IN JAVASCRIPT OVER HTML?

This project has a lot of DOM manipulation practice, which is a great refresher. 
A lot of the webpage display code is moving towards being defined in JavaScript via
DOM manipulation script. 

A new kind of confusion will be a challenge: if I want to change the initial HTML/DOM structure,
I need to figure out if the code may lie in the HTML file or defined by some JavaScript source file 
somewhere. Dev Tools will help.

THE <dialog> HTML ELEMENT

The <dialog> HTML element deserves its own introduction. I wish The Odin Project provided more practice
with <form> and <dialog>, especially in how these are so important to the Create New Book feature.

NOT ENOUGH OBJECT CONSTRUCTION OR PROTOTYPE PRACTICE? 

Personally I don't see enough practice in prototypes. Certainly something I 
want to get a better hang of coming from other OOP languages like C++.

Prototypical inheritance seems to be a big thing in JavaScript. MDN docs mention 
it a lot.

Well, Odin doesn't dwelve on constructors for good reason, as explained in the next 
lesson in the course. Factories huh?

MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER

I spent significant effort trying to reconcile the DOM with the myLibrary 
array of Book objects. Especially for code dealing with affecting one specific 
book in myLibrary. 

This effort reminds me of the Model-View-Controller design pattern:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVCand 

Here's how I think it can apply to this project:

- The Model is the Book class, storing all the properties and methods on each Book object
- Arguably, the myLibrary array of Book objects can be considered part of the model too?
- The Controller should be all the other functions I wrote to interact with the myLibrary, 
each Book inside it, and reconcile with the View. Maybe group them into some Librarian object.
- The View is the DOM itself with all the buttons.

Honestly, the real complaint is that I just don't know how to write good Controllers.
And that this project focuses too much on this at this point in the course.

ADDENDUM: HOW I HANDLED myLibrary AND BOOK CARDS

To change the Book object itself is easy if somewhat clunky. Use the data-id attribute
and find the index of the Book object with a matching id property inside the myLibrary array.
It's as clunky as Array.prototype.findIndex() should be. O(n) where n is number of books?

To change the "book card" div on the webpage, I relied on using event.target.parentNode:
- the event should be a "click" on some button.
- the target is the button element.
- the parentNode is the "book card" div the button is a child of.

On top of that, to remove the book, I also need access to the parent of the "book cards". 
And to change the "is read" text, I had to query for the <p> element under the book card.

I have to get used to querying for elements like this. I know I can always use id or class
selectors but I prefer less code.
